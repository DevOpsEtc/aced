   ACED: AWS Cloud Easy Deploy

```

AWS Cloud Easy Deploy (ACED) is an Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instance generator. Highly opinionated, yet user configurable, ACED automates the provisioning of a fast, secure and lightweight cloud environment to serve websites built by static site generators, such as [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), [Hexo](https://hexo.io) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). Since ACED is comprised of bash scripts, it can be expanding upon to install the run-time and/or server scripting of your choice to serve dynamic websites and/or even web apps.

**Road Map:**
- Install MTA (fail2ban notifications)
- Add IP6Tables rules
- Implement port knocking
- Install openVPN

**PRs welcome, or just fork it (YMMV!)**
