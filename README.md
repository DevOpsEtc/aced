### ACED: AWS Cloud Easy Deploy (Snowflake EC2 Instance Generator)

ACED is a highly opinionated, yet user configurable, EC2 instance generator and system administration helper— an EC2 instance in an instant! This project uses a series of Bash shell scripts that tap into the AWS API via the aws-cli tool to quickly deploy a secure and lightweight server ready for you to run a static website or install the run-time and/or server scripting of your choice to serve dynamic websites and/or web apps. Once it’s up, you can easily administer it with canned AWS, OS, app and service level commands from the comfort of the command line— goodbye AWS web console.
